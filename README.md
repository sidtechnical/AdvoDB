Global Advocay Database

**1. What is the "Global Advocacy Database" project all about?**

There are a lot of advocacy and civil society organizations around the globe, specifically those who use technology for the betterment of society and fight for our digital rights. However, unless and until a person is within those communities, it is hard to find information about such organizations. To foster the advocacy sector in general and to encourage more people to participate in _"public interest (computer) science_", we are collecting information about all those organizations from everywhere possible. This is to help the newcomers to know the possible opportunities in advocacy sector based on their preferences of location, type of work and opportunities to collaborate. 

In short, the "Global Advocacy Database" is an online platform where one can search for information about all advocacy and civil society organizations.

_P.S: This is a sub-project of our "**Advocacy as a career**" project. More information will be made publically available soon._
